University of Texas at Dallas IEEE Valentine's Day 2016 Hackathon
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The challenge was to control a crossbow mounted on a servo motor
which was connected to an Arduino Uno and win a target shooting
contest. Originally, our code was supposed to run autonomously,
but the homemade crossbows were too heavy for the servo motors
to operate consistently, so the kinematic elements only serve as a
rough estimate of initial aim.  Also, the kinematic equations were
solved on paper and hard-coded, so please forgive unlabeled,
hard-coded constants. There were three crossbows mounted on a table
approximately 4 meters from the target, and contestants were randomly
assigned to a different one on each round. Each crossbow had a
secondary servo which acted as a trigger.

To compensate for the servo's inconsistencies is was necessary to
write serial commands to aim the motors and fire.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Commands:

['1'|'2'|'3'] : select which crossbow's trajectory estimate to initialize
'u' : tilt servo up
'd' : tilt servo down
'r' : rotate right
'l' : rotate left
'f' : fire

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Results: 

2nd place overall, competing individualy
